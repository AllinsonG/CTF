# Welcome

Starting to give an interest on CTF correlated thing, although still beginner at the moment. This is a place for my writeup towards the CTF competition that i have been participated in. Mostly focused on PWN but sometimes give a shot for Reversing and Web Exploitation. Sorry in advance if my write up is incomprehensible but hope this would help.
